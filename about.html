        <h1>Documentation</h1>
        <p>
            I'm just going to come right out and say that this is one of my favorite projects that I have done, and I am really in love with the idea. I can definitely see myself making this into a fuller game with more content. The process behind this project was
            pretty simple, i planned out what I wanted the gameplay to be like and then went from there. I wish I had a bit more time to add some cooler features, but what I have now I think stands on its own.
            <br><br> While making this game, I ran into a lot of hiccups and roadblocks with the logic. Transitioning between states of gameplay was a very big issue and took me a long time to solve. Also, the little animations I did were also tricky
            to get working in a consistant manner.
            <br><br>I tried to add as much polish as I could and make everything look pleasing to the eye, which I believe I achieved. The buttons and transitions between scenes could use some work, but other than that I think everything looks great.
            I did all of the art and sounds myself as well. I believe my project definitely met all of the requirements for this project, and went a bit beyond as well.
            <br><br>Overall, had a really fun time making this project, but pixi.js can be terrible sometimes haha.

        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>In <em>Prichi</em>, you traverse through randomized chessboard layouts as you take out every opposing chess piece that stands in your way! You start with just a Queen, but can find other pieces scattered around and add them to your party. The
            goal of each level is to eliminate every other chess piece on the board. Try and get through as many levels as you can!
        </p>

    <div class="info-section">
        <h1>Genre</h1>
        <p>Dungeon Crawler / Arcade / Turn-based Strategy
            <br><br>These 3 genres are my favorite genres to play, and so I tried to combine them into a game that was not only fun for me to create, but fun for others to play.

        <h1>Platform</h1>
        <p>Desktop Web (but hopefully with mobile support as well by the time I have to submit the project)</p>

        <h1>Story</h1>
        <p>At the time of writing this, there is no deeper meaning or story. However, that might change as the game gets developed further.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section">
        <h1>Aesthetics</h1>
        <p>The game will have a pixel art style. Simple, and can have a really unique effect on the atmosphere for the game. I am very fond of pixel art styled games, and love to make my games with graphics like them.</p>
    </div>

        <h1>Gameplay</h1>
        <p>I want to keep the gameplay of the game as simple as possible but still make it require some strategy and thought power.
            <br><br>When you start a level, a random level layout is created. Based on the level size, a certain amount of black chess pieces are placed randomly throughout. You then choose where to start your white chess pieces. At the start of the game,
            you only start with a Queen piece, but can find other white chess pieces and add them to your party as you go.
            <br><br>At the bottom of the screen, there will be a "turn order" of the opposing pieces. Only 1 of the pieces on either side (your party or the opposing party) can move each turn. The "turn order" at the bottom tells you which of the opposing
            pieces will move next.
            <br><br>To beat a level, you must capture all of the other chess pieces on the board. If you lose your queen piece, you lose. You can lose other pieces that you collect without losing, but you lose them for good after that (unless you find
            another one in a later level).

        <h1>Mock-ups</h1>
        <p>
            Below is a quick sketch I made when I was coming up the idea. It's very crude and not at all representative of the game, but it's good enough. The other is a spritesheet that I made of the pieces that will be in the game (as of now). It's blurry because
            I'm scaling it up very far and the pieces are very small.

        <h1>About The Developer</h1>
        <p>My name is Frank Alfano and I am a 2nd year Game Design and Development major, going for a Computer Science minor. I have been programming since 5th grade and have a good amount of experience developing games.
            <br><br>Personally, I use C# and Unity a lot, so web development in Javascript has been an interesting experience for me. I love to incorperate randomness into my games, and am fascinated with procedural generation. I'm also a really big fan
            of puzzle games.
            <br><br>I believe <em>Prichi</em> is a very good mix of all the aspects of game design that I like creating, so I am looking forward to making a cool and unique game for others to play!</p>
